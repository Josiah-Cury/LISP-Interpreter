How to run the project:
	1. go into source folder.
	2. run 'make'
	3. type 'java Interpreter' (case-sensitive)
	4. Enjoy! (the outfile is labeled as "result.file")

The only function that does not work is defun. I have not implemented this function,
but every other single lisp construct works as intended!
